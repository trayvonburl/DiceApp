This Dice Roller app was built to recreate a basic Android project while learning how to structure and design mobile applications using Kotlin and XML. The app lets the user roll a virtual die and see the result as both a number and an image. It also saves each roll in a list so the user can look back at their history. The goal of this project was to understand how to connect the user interface with the app logic, handle state changes, and use Android resources correctly instead of hard coding any values.
